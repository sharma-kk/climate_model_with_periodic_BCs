# climate_model_with_periodic_BCs
Two differnt test cases were simulated (with and without Coriolis effect):
1. Complete coupling: The ocean heats the atmosphere which starts the atmospheric flow which in turn affects the ocean dynamics. 
We can observe the coupling of both the temperature and the velocity.
2. Velocity coupling: The ocean and the atmosphere are kept at the same temperatures. The atmosphere is given some initial velocity (to simulate wind gust)
and its effect of the ocean is observed.

.pvsm files contain the simulation results for different test scenarios.
